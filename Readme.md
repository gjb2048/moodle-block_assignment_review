The user problems
-----------------
Archbishopsâ€™ Council needs meet the needs in British Higher Education for a second marker or moderator to make comments
on the marking of an assignment as a whole.  Often comments on how the external examiner marked the students, note on
how to markstudents.

The solutions
-------------
In order for the reviewers to post "global" comment about assignment, a new Moodle block will display threaded comments
per assignment on assignment pages.  The plugin should  also allow the insertion of key markers or text that can be picked
up in database queries, for example using the Configurable Reports plugin. These markers can be into the comments or in
additional field till the solution is simple to set up with the configurable report plugin.

Project features
----------------
This block would function in a way very similar to the existing comments block but with some added functionality which
would be configurable at a site level. This additional functionality would comprise of the following, configured at
site level.

1. Ability to Name the Block.
2. Ability to set text under the heading that can act as instructions on correct use.
3. Select buttons where one only must be selected to indicate the status the person holds in relation to the comment posted.
   Text is add to the top of the message based on which button is selected. The number of buttons, the titles of the buttons
   and the text to be added would be configured at a site level via plugin settings. Thus the following three buttons would
   be created by the following text in the config setting and generate corresponding text at the start of the message when
   saved.  If no buttons are listed then none would be displayed or required.
4. Additional select buttons where one or more could be selected to indicate certain issues, eg "Important" or "Re-marking
   required".  These would again add text into the comment text when saved.  The idea is that this text can be searched for
   and comments displayed via 'Configurable Reports', but saving it as part of the comment removes any need to change how
   information is stored in the database eg adding extra fields, it is simply stored as part of the comment text.  If no buttons
   are listed then none would be displayed.

The permissions must prevent student access to any comments, indeed they should not ever see this block. Other read, write delete
permission could be set.  As far as I can tell, the existing comments system could be used as is.
